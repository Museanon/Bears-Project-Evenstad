Hi everyone, ceci est mon hypoth√©tique projet de master.

### Background: 
The Scandinavian Brown Bear Research Project conducts annual aerial surveys during the active season (May ‚Äì August) to assess the presence and numbers of cubs-of-the-year as well as litter losses. However, this method does not allow to detect all mortality events as some cubs die inside the den and between den emergence and the first monitoring (personal observations, Andrea Friebe). Females with cubs-of-the-year tend to stay longer near the denning site after emergence (Gardner et al., 2014, Lemi√®re et al., 2022), and after leaving the area, they exhibit a smaller home range, shorter travelled distances, lower movement rates (km/h) and a different daily activity pattern compared to solitary females (Gardner et al., 2014; Steyaert et al., 2013).
These differences disappear when the female lose her cubs (Gardner et al., 2014; Steyaert et al., 2013).!

#### Dataset: 
We will use an extensive dataset from the SBBRP including Scandinavian brown bear females from 2003 to 2023. These females have been equipped with a GPS collar fitted with a triaxial accelerometer (VERTEX Plus, Vectronics) and were monitored by aerial survey the following spring to assess the presence of COYs. For each individual, the exact position of the den was obtained by visiting the area where clusters of GPS positions were observed during the previous winter after the bear had left the area in spring, or directly based on the position of these clusters if such visit was not conducted. 
Required data:
‚Ä¢	Acceleration
‚Ä¢	GPS positions
‚Ä¢	Den positions
‚Ä¢	Cubs aerial survey
