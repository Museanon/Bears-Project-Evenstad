## Use movement/activity data to assess presence of cubs-of-the-year (COYs) at den emergence before the first aerial monitoring

Hi everyone, ceci est mon hypoth√©tique projet de master.

### Background: 
The Scandinavian Brown Bear Research Project conducts annual aerial surveys during the active season (May ‚Äì August) to assess the presence and numbers of cubs-of-the-year as well as litter losses. However, this method does not allow to detect all mortality events as some cubs die inside the den and between den emergence and the first monitoring (personal observations, Andrea Friebe). Females with cubs-of-the-year tend to stay longer near the denning site after emergence (Gardner et al., 2014, Lemi√®re et al., 2022), and after leaving the area, they exhibit a smaller home range, shorter travelled distances, lower movement rates (km/h) and a different daily activity pattern compared to solitary females (Gardner et al., 2014; Steyaert et al., 2013).
These differences disappear when the female lose her cubs (Gardner et al., 2014; Steyaert et al., 2013).!
